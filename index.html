                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure your website is simple to navigate. Visitors should be able to discover what they’re looking for fast and straightforwardly. Avoid using technical or jargon terms that your visitors may not understand. Make sure that you’re producing clear and concise writing. Include calls to action in your material. Tell readers what you want them to do, such as sign up for your newsletter or purchase your product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure your website is visually appealing. Make use of high-resolution pictures and videos that are relevant to your material. Make sure your website is mobile-friendly. People are increasingly using their cell phones to browse the web. Check whether your website can easily be viewed on a small screen.
                </p>
